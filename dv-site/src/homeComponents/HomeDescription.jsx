              The role of eIF5A hypusination must be considered in the context
              of the cell-type specificity as well as the underlying
              physiological and/or pathological processes. Our strategy exploits
              the hypusine loop moiety with seemingly profound impact on TDP-43
              pathology. Regarding TDP-43 pathology our findings suggest that
              eIF5A hypusination pathway orchestrates a multifaceted response;
              eIF5AHyp in worsen TDP-43 accumulation, and Induced eIF5AHyp
              caused deficits in mitochondrial TCA cycle and ATP production,
              leading to reduced neurometabolic profile.
